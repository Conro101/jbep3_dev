SendTo FTP 
Version 2.8 freeware
Copyright © 1998-2003 Peili Chen

SendTo FTP is an easy-to-use file transfer program
for sending files from your local PC to a remote host, 
very handy and time saving for web page publishing and updating.
It will make your file uploading one click away.

To use SendTo FTP, select the files you want to send
in Windows Explorer or My Computer in Windows PC, 
click right mouse button to popup the popupmenu, 
and choose SendTo FTP in Send To submenu.

When use SendTo FTP for the first time, 
fill in the hostname, address, username and password.
The last used details will be save in Windows registry.
The second time you use it, only thing to do is press OK.
If you have used it for several different host accounts,
pull down the hostname edit box to retrieve the used details.

If you choose to put your files in a sub-directory 
but not sure which directory to put into,
pull down the sub-directory edit box, 
SendTo FTP will get the directory list 
from the remote host for you.
Pull down the sub-directory edit box 
while you already have a directory name in it,
SendTo FTP will get further sub-directories
in that directory. 

Hold down Ctrl or Shift key to select more than one file
in Windows Explorer or My Computer.
The average maximum number of files you can send at a time
is about 10, depends on the file path length.
If you see a message "Access to the specified device,
path, or file is denied" when use SendTo FTP,
that is because you select too many files at a time 
and Microsoft Windows doesn't like it.
